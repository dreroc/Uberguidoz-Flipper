If the nRF modeul is acting a bit flakey, try adding a capacitor to the vcc/gnd lines! I've not tried the Plus model so it may have a bigger need for a cap. Otherwise, I haven't had any major issues. Anything from a 3.3 uF to 10 uF should do. (Watch your positive/negative placement! Negative to ground.) I learned if you wanna get fancy, include a 0.1 uF cap in parallel. The 3.3 uF to 10 uF will respond to slow freq changes while the 0.1 uF will respond to the high freq switching spikes that the larger one cannot. That said, a single 10 uF will likely suffice for the Mousejack attack. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
